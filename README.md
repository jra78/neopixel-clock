# neopixel-clock
Clock based on WS2812B leds and arduino

You will need also Adafruit neopixel library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel & https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library

Used RTC is some random module from DX.com and it uses DS1307 chip. library http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_DS1307RTC.html

Time library http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html

You may have to change code, because I have used quite old versions of those librarys.
